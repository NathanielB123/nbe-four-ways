# NbE Four Ways: In Agda!

Based on the excellent blog post from William Bowman: [Normalization by Evaluation Four Ways: Reconstructing NbE Designs from First Principles](https://williamjbowman.com/tmp/nbe-four-ways/). I extend the syntax with natural numbers and their recursor to make things more interesting.

It turns out that only [Choice12.agda](./Choice12.agda) and [Choice2.agda](./Choice2.agda) satisfy Agda's positivity and termination checks, so I'd recommend starting with those.
